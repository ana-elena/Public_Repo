Good Books Readings

The aim is to build a recommendation system for good books readings. 

The user is asked to enter the title of a book he wants to read or has already read and the system will propose him some book readings. 

First step would be to understand the dataset provided in Kaggle. 

Unfortunatelly kaggle dataset gives no information about the kind of book; building clusters using the books genre for a recommendation system is not possible. 

Goodreads API wil be used to get the popular shelves.
